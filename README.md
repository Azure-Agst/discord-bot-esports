# SJPII eSports Discord Bot

## How to use

```
npm install
node start.js
```

If running using heroku, Iâ€™ve already put a Procfile in the repo, so just push to heroku or sync the github repo, and use the dashboard to start the worker.

If running using a spare computer or server you own, I recommend installing and using `tmux` to create a vm, start it using the commands above, and then detaching from the VM by pressing Ctrl-B and then D. Your bot should keep running in the background.

## How to modify

Most of the modifiable data is located in `./bot.json`. 

- Name: Bot name used internally
- Version: Version of the bot.
- Prefix: The 1 character prefix to look for with commands
- Token: The token you get from the discord development panel
- API: Link to Twitch API json response for our eSports page.
- Changelog: What is loaded as the description when you run !Changelog

Commands are stored in arrays. `Command[0]` is the command, and everything from `command[1]` onwards are the params.

The switch statement is the main brain of the bot, it checks `command[0]` for a keyword. Simply add a case to add a command, and make sure you signify the end with `break;`

## Other Stuff

This bot uses [Discord.js](https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js/). You can read the documentation [here](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome).
